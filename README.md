Project Information:

This small project consists of two different versions of a utility script that I wrote in order to be able to interact with my linux PC while away from it via text messages. Assuming that you already have a Twilio account created with an active phone number and adequate funds, in order for this to work on your PC you must:

1. Install Twilio dependencies for python via 'pip install twilio'
2. Install ngrok https://ngrok.com/download
3. Open up a new terminal window and run 'ngrok http 5000'
4. Copy the address generated by ngrok
5. Login to your Twilio console -> active phone numbers -> messaging/webhook url
6. Paste ngrok address into the first URL field under the 'Messaging' header for the desired phone number
7. Open up a new terminal window and run 'python secure_hal.py' or 'python sketchy_hal.py'
8. Text your respective Twilio phone number with a message and wait for response 👍 
-> (If you are running sketchy_hal.py, raw bash commands must be denoted by a preceding > character)

This program consists of two files; secure_hal.py, and sketchy_hal.py. These are two different versions of the program based on how much you care (or don't care) about your personal computer being compromised. WARNING: If you are using sketchy_hal.py, do not tell anyone the phone number you use for your SMS communication with your PC. If someone else knows your Twilio phone number, they can send your computer arbitrary shell commands o__O.
